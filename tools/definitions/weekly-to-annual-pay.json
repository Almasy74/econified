    "insights": [
        "Using 52 weeks is mathematically inaccurate for hourly workers because it assumes zero unpaid sick days, holidays, or vacations over the entire year. 48 or 50 is a much safer estimation metric.",
        "If your weekly pay fluctuates wildly (e.g., hospitality shifts), find your total pay over the last 4 weeks, divide by 4, and use that running average here."

            "q": "Why is assuming 52 weeks of pay risky?",
            "a": "If you are strictly paid weekly based on hours, assuming 52 weeks means you are literally planning to work every single weekday without a single vacation day or sick day."

        {
            "q": "How do I calculate a short-term contract?",

        {
            "q": "How many weeks are in a standard working year with holidays?",
            "a": "A standard European full-time contract implies roughly 46-47 actual working weeks, with the remainder being paid vacation. If you are hourly, use 47 to estimate realistic annual yield."

        {
            "q": "Does this calculation include taxes?",
            "a": "No, this produces the Gross annual income. Taxes must be calculated distinctly against the final annual sum."

        {
            "q": "Why is the Monthly Average calculated by dividing by 12?",
            "a": "While you might be paid weekly, most fixed expenses (rent, utilities) occur on a monthly cadence. Dividing the annual total by 12 provides the safest monthly budgeting baseline."
        },
        {
            "q": "What if my weekly pay includes overtime?",
            "a": "If you consistently work overtime, include it in your weekly average. However, doing so builds a budget dependent on working more than standard hours, which carries a high risk of burnout."
