            "a": "Usually 20-30%. This accounts for self-employment taxes (approx 15.3% in the US), healthcare premiums, skipped pension contributions, and unpaid sick days."

        {
            "q": "Why is 'Contractor True Equivalent' lower than 'Gross Revenue'?",
            "a": "Because Gross Revenue is business cash flow, not your salary. The True Equivalent backs out the business costs your employer normally pays."

        {
            "q": "Do I need to account for software or hardware expenses?",
            "a": "Yes. If you must buy your own laptop and software licenses as a contractor, mentally raise the overhead percentage to compensate."
        },
        {
            "q": "Why is standard salaried PTO omitted from the employee side?",
            "a": "Because the employee receives the full salary regardless of taking the 4 weeks PTO. The contractor loses billable hours when taking PTO, which is handled via 'Weeks/Year'."

        {
            "q": "If the difference is negative, should I avoid contracting?",
            "a": "Mathematically yes. A negative difference means you are taking on all the business risk of contracting while effectively taking a pay cut."
