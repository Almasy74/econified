            "q": "How does unpaid overtime impact this calculation?",

            "q": "Does this tool calculate my take-home hourly pay?",

            "q": "What happens if I change the 'Weeks per Year' input?",
            "a": "Reducing the weeks worked (for instance, if you take unpaid leave) without changing the annual salary will result in a higher calculated hourly rate for the time you actually work."
