        {
            "q": "What does an index of 100 mean?",
            "a": "An index of 100 is typically the baseline city (often New York City in global datasets). If a city has an index of 80, it is 20% cheaper than the baseline."

        {
            "q": "Does this calculation include rent?",
            "a": "That depends entirely on the index you use. Make sure the index you look up explicitly says 'Cost of Living Plus Rent Index' if you are relocating."
        },
        {
            "q": "Why is the adjusted pay lower?",
            "a": "If your local city index is lower than the company's HQ index, the mathematical 'purchasing power' translates to a lower adjusted value. It means you can buy the same standard of living for less."

        {
            "q": "Is it fair for companies to adjust pay by geography?",
            "a": "This is a heavily debated topic. Some companies pay strictly for value (no adjustment), while others maintain strict geographical pay bands to assure internal equity."

        {
            "q": "How can I use this to negotiate?",
            "a": "If you know the company uses cost of living indices, you can calculate the exact delta they are applying and counter-offer if their index source is flawed."
