            "q": "What happens to my annual salary if I work unpaid overtime?",
            "a": "Working unpaid overtime mathematically decreases your true hourly rate while keeping your annual salary fixed in the calculation."
        },
        {
            "q": "Why is the default set to 52 weeks per year?",
            "a": "Salaried positions generally pay you for 52 weeks, including paid time off (PTO). If you are strictly paid only for weeks worked, you should lower the weeks metric."

        {
            "q": "Does this calculation include taxes?",
            "a": "No. This tool calculates Gross Pay (before taxes). Net Pay depends heavily on your local tax region, brackets, and personal deductions."

        {
            "q": "Is a contract rate directly comparable to a salary rate?",
            "a": "No, directly converting an hourly contract rate to an annual salary is misleading because contractors lack PTO, health benefits, and pay self-employment taxes."

        {
            "q": "How does an annual bonus factor into this calculation?",
            "a": "This tool strictly calculates base pay from hourly wages. If you receive predictable bonuses, calculate the base annual salary here first, then add the bonus separately."
