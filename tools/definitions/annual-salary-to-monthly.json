            "q": "Why is the input for 'Months Paid' editable?",

        {
            "q": "Does this tool calculate my net take-home pay?",
            "a": "No. Tax structures vary wildly by jurisdiction. This tool calculates the proportional division of your contractual Gross Salary."
        },
        {
            "q": "How can I figure out my take-home pay from this number?",
            "a": "You must apply your local, state, and national income tax brackets to your Annual Salary, subtract deductions, and divide the remaining Net result by 12."
        },
        {
            "q": "What happens if I receive quarterly bonuses?",
            "a": "Bonuses are not strictly guaranteed base salary. Do not include performance bonuses in your 'Annual Salary' input if you want to find your reliable base monthly cash flow."
        },
        {
            "q": "Why doesn't my monthly salary track directly to 160 hours worked?",
            "a": "Because a month averages 173.3 billable working hours. Dividing annual salary by 12 smoothes out short months (February) and longer months."
        },
        {
            "q": "Is the calculated monthly salary what my employer pays in total?",
            "a": "No, your employer pays an additional 'burden rate' adding 20-40% to your gross salary to cover their portion of taxes, benefits, and workplace insurance."
