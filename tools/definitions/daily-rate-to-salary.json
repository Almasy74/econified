        "Never multiply your daily rate by 260 (52 weeks × 5 days) without subtracting vacations, sick days, and non-billable bench time. 220 or 230 days is a safer maximum.",

        {
            "q": "Should I charge a higher daily rate than my current salary division?",
            "a": "Yes. Daily rate contractors should typically charge a 30-50% premium over their salaried daily equivalent to absorb the risk of downtime and lack of benefits."
        },
        {
            "q": "How do I account for public holidays?",
            "a": "Subtract the public holidays from your total working weeks. Instead of 52 weeks, calculate using 46 or 47 weeks."

        {
            "q": "Why is daily rate common in IT and Consulting?",
            "a": "It simplifies billing for clients. They don't have to track your hourly movements, and you are paid for output per day rather than punching a clock."
