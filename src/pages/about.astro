      <h1>About Econified</h1>
      
      <p>
        Econified is a collection of interactive tools designed to help people understand salary, work, and income decisions through simple calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform provides browser-based calculators that help users explore scenarios such as salary conversions, freelance pricing, and compensation comparisons.
      </p>
      <p>
        All calculations run locally in your browser. Econified does not require accounts and does not store personal financial information.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Econified was created to make common work and income questions easier to understand through transparent and adjustable calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of providing advice, the platform helps users explore outcomes by changing assumptions and viewing results instantly.
      </p>

      <h2>How the Tools Work</h2>
      <p>
        Each tool uses clearly defined formulas and assumptions. Users can adjust inputs to model their own situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results are estimates intended for informational purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2>Independence</h2>
      <p>
        Econified operates independently and does not provide financial, tax, or legal advice.
