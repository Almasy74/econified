      <p>
        Hi, we're the team behind Econified. We built this platform because we realized that most work-related decisions—like switching to a new job or going freelance—often come down to numbers that are surprisingly hard to compare fairly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Econified is a collection of interactive tools designed to help you strip away the noise and understand the core math behind your career decisions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy is a priority here. All calculations run locally in your browser. We don't require accounts, and your personal financial data never leaves your own computer.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Econified was created to make common work and income questions easier to understand through transparent and adjustable calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of providing advice, the platform helps users explore outcomes by changing assumptions and viewing results instantly.
      </p>

      <h2>How the Tools Work</h2>
      <p>
        Each tool uses clearly defined formulas and assumptions. Users can adjust inputs to model their own situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results are estimates intended for informational purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2>Independence</h2>
      <p>
        Econified operates independently and does not provide financial, tax, or legal advice.
